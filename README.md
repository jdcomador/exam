UI/UX Implementation
- I do the simple UI showing all of the details I think is necessary in one page for the ease of navigation and use. I use html, bootstrap, and jquery for this exam but I don't think this is the best implementation. There are better ways like Vue.js and other js framework for front-end but I don't have any experience using it so I decided to use these instead.

Code Implementation
- I don't know if this is the best code implementation but I tried to do it as easy to understand as possible in terms of the flow of the process.

PS: add these in .env file to run
